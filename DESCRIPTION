Description: Several methods have been developed to integrate structural equation modeling techniques with network data analysis to examine the relationship between network and non-network data. Both node-based and edge-based information can be extracted from the network data to be used as observed variables in structural equation modeling. To facilitate the application of these methods, model specification can be performed in the familiar syntax of the 'lavaan' package, ensuring ease of use for researchers. Technical details and examples can be found at <https://bigsem.psychstat.org>.
