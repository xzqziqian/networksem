\usage{
sem.net.edge(
  model = NULL,
  data = NULL,
  type = "difference",
  ordered = NULL,
  sampling.weights = NULL,
  data.rescale = FALSE,
  group = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{a model specified in lavaan model syntax.}

\item{data}{a list containing both the non-network and network data}

\item{type}{"difference" for using the difference between the network statistics of the two actors as the edge covariate; "average" for using the average of the network statistics of the two actors as the edge covariate}

\item{ordered}{parameter same as "ordered" in the lavaan sem() function; whether to treat data as ordinal}

\item{sampling.weights}{parameter same as "sampling.weights" in the lavaan sem() function; whether to apply weights to data}

\item{data.rescale}{whether to rescale the whole dataset (with restructured network and nonnetwork data) to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1 when fitting it to SEM, default to FALSE}

\item{group}{parameter same as "group" in the lavaan sem() function; whether to fit a multigroup model}

\item{cluster}{parameter same as "cluster" in the lavaan sem() function; whether to fit a cluster model}

\item{constraints}{parameter same as "constraints" in the lavaan sem() function; whether to apply constraints to the model}

\item{WLS.V}{parameter same as "WLS.V" in the lavaan sem() function; whether to use WLS.V estimator}

\item{NACOV}{parameter same as "NACOV" in the lavaan sem() function; whether to use NACOV estimator}

\item{...}{optional arguments for the sem() function}
}
\value{
the updated model specification and a lavaan object which is the SEM results, and the data generated
}
