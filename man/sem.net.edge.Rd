\title{Fit a Structural Equation Model (SEM) with both network and non-network data by transforming nonnetwork data into paired values corresponding to network edge values.}
\usage{
sem.net.edge(
  model = NULL,
  data = NULL,
  type = "difference",
  ordered = NULL,
  sampling.weights = NULL,
  data.rescale = FALSE,
  group = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A model string specified in lavaan model syntax that includes relationships among the network and non-network variables.}

\item{data}{A list containing the data. The list has two named components, "network" and "nonnetwork"; "network" is a list of named adjacency matrices for the network data, and "nonnetwork" is the dataframe of non-network covariates.}

\item{type}{Option for transforming nonnework data; "difference" for using the difference between two individuals as the edge covariate; "average" for using the average between two individuals as the edge covariate.}

\item{ordered}{Parameter same as "ordered" in the lavaan sem() function; whether to treat data as ordinal.}

\item{sampling.weights}{Parameter same as "sampling.weights" in the lavaan sem() function; whether to apply weights to data.}

\item{data.rescale}{TRUE or FALSE, whether to rescale the whole dataset (with restructured network and nonnetwork data) to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1 when fitting it to SEM, default to FALSE.}

\item{group}{Parameter same as "group" in the lavaan sem() function; whether to fit a multigroup model.}

\item{cluster}{Parameter same as "cluster" in the lavaan sem() function; whether to fit a cluster model.}

\item{netstats.rescale}{TRUE or FALSE, whether to rescale the network statistics to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1, default to FALSE.}

\item{constraints}{Parameter same as "constraints" in the lavaan sem() function; whether to apply constraints to the model.}

\item{WLS.V}{Parameter same as "WLS.V" in the lavaan sem() function; whether to use WLS.V estimator.}

\item{NACOV}{Parameter same as "NACOV" in the lavaan sem() function; whether to use NACOV estimator.}

\item{...}{Optional arguments for the sem() function.}
}
\value{
A networksem object containing the updated model specification string with the reconstructed network statistics as variables and a lavaan SEM object.
